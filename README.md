### NestJS used as nodejs progressive framework for this application
```bash
Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

#### CQRS used as design pattern for this application 
```bash
CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It's a pattern that I first heard described by Greg Young. At its heart is the notion that you can use a different model to update information than the model you use to read information.
the CQRS model may be more appropriate and scalable. To facilitate that model, Nest provides a lightweight CQRS module.
